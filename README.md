This project was planned, and built from December 30, 2020 - January 19, 2020

The purpose of the project was to demonstrate the full-stack capabilities I have learned over the past 3 months of my boot camp experience at DevMountain.

This project aims to solve the problem of keeping track of time spent working on specific projects. 


Technologies/techniques used to solve the problem:
Javascript
React
Node
PostgreSQL
Express
Massive
HTML
CSS
Sass
Nodemailer


I did not build the stopwatch myself. I was able to find some instructive material here:

I saved the stopwatch on the front end, only saving the data that was changed at the end.
